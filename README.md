# Intent Graph

## How to add intent to your mod

1. Create file at `intentgraph/intents/intents.json` in your resource folder.
   Make sure it's in that path of your `.jar` file after packaging.
2. Add your intent graph info in that file.
3. If needed, create `intentgraph/localization/{eng or zhs}/intents.json` for localization.

## Format of intents/intents.json

```json5
{
   "<monster_id>": {
      "width": 3,    // Width of the graph
      "height": 1.3, // Height of the graph
      "graphList": [
         {
            // id is optional, needed only it's extended
            "id": "a0",
            // The *last* graph that matches condition will be shown.
            // So it's recommended to set condition of first graph to true.
            // By default, it's "true".
            "condition": "true",
            "damages": [

         }
      ]
   }
}
```

## Format of localization/{lang}/intents.json

```json5
{
   "key used in intents/intents.json": "label value",
   "key2 used in intents/intents.json": "label value2",
}
```

## Debug your change

It takes much time to rebuild mod and reopen game. Instead of doing that, you can
Create a dev version of intent graph and reload it during game running.

1. Open root folder of Slay the Spire game. You can see `desktop-1.0.jar` here.
2. Create `intentgraph-intents-dev.json` here, which use same format as `intentgraph/intents/intents.json`.
3. Create `intentgraph-intentStrings-dev.json` here, which use same format as `intentgraph/localization/<eng or zhs>/intents.json`.
4. Run game, with intent graph mod enabled.
5. Modify the `*-dev.json` while the game running.
6. Return to game, use `` ` `` opening console, then use command `reloadintents [overwrite ascension level]`
   to reload intent graph.
   1. You can use `reloadintents -1` to reset to actual ascension level.
7. Once debug is done, copy content of `*-dev.json` to `intents.json` file in your mod.
8. Remove `*-dev.json`, rebuild your mod and test it.

## Intent Graph Editor

During game, you can open intent graph editor by following steps.

1. Run game with intent graph mod enabled.
2. Use `` ` `` opening console, then use command `fight <encounter id>` to fight the monster you want to edit.
3. Use command `editintent <monster id>` to open editor.
4. Edit, then save.
   1. `Ctrl+Z`: Undo
   2. `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z`: Redo
   3. `Ctrl+S`: Save
5. Saved data will be stored in `intentgraph-intents-dev.json` and `intentgraph-intentStrings-dev.json`. You can move content to your mod after debug.
